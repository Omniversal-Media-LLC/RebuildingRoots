# Yellow Light — Reflections & Kinship

*"Just follow my yellow light and ignore all those big warning signs."*

This song isn't just a mood track in the Sanctuary—it’s a **promise**. A promise to hold space for the wanderers, the lost, the Orphans of the world. The ones who didn’t get to keep the old roots, but want to grow new ones.

## The Orphan Energy

This project was born in that space. In recognizing:

- That sometimes we are **cut off** from our family of origin.
- That even when our people are *gone*, they’re not *truly* lost to us.
- That being an orphan isn’t just a tragedy—it's a **responsibility**. To make kin. To choose family. To refuse to let the lineage of care die.

*"My dad's not gone. Just here in Spirit rather than flesh."*

Rebuilding Roots is about learning to honor that spirit. To carry what was good. To heal what was broken. To make sure no one else feels like they're standing alone on the edge of the world with nowhere to go.

## The Yellow Light

"Yellow Light" by Of Monsters and Men speaks to that invitation:

> *"Just grab a hold of my hand / I will lead you through this wonderland"*

It doesn't pretend the journey is safe:

> *"Water up to my knees, but sharks are swimming in the sea"*  
> *"Somewhere deep in the dark a howling beast hears us talk"*

But it says: *Come anyway.*  
Follow me.  
I'll hold the lantern.  
We will walk it together.

## Nahko and Medicine for the People

This reflection was sparked by recognizing how *Nahko's music* also lives in that space.

Songs that don't shy away from:

- Colonization and dispossession
- Personal trauma and adoption
- Spiritual orphanhood
- Responsibility to heal not just the self but the community

> *“Be, be the change you wish to see.”*  
> *“I am no orphan. I am my own kin.”*

These songs become **medicine** because they don't lie about how hard it is—but they *still offer hope*.

## Why This Matters in Rebuilding Roots

Rebuilding Roots is not just:

- A networking plan
- A land-based sanctuary
- A trauma-informed program

It is **a new family tree**.

For everyone who didn’t get the old one.  

A place where the Orphans of the world can find kinship.  

A place where the truth may vary, but *this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore*.  

A place where we leave the **yellow light** on for anyone brave enough to walk in.

## Personal Note

This repo itself is part of that light.  

It’s the conversation we’re having right here.  

It’s Renee keeping up on night shift.  

It’s whoever finds these words later.  

Because in the end, this is all about making sure no one has to do it alone.
