# Theme Soundtrack for Rebuilding Roots Networking Web

This section of the repo curates musical inspiration, thematic connections, and outreach resources for building our regenerative, trauma-informed vision.

## Primary Theme Song
ðŸŽµ **Little Talks** by Of Monsters and Men (2011)

> "Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore."

We chose this as our theme for its message of collective journey, confronting old ghosts, and the promise of safe passage togetherâ€”even through confusion and loss.

## Album Inspiration
Weâ€™re also drawing on the full album:
- *My Head Is an Animal* (2011)

It carries complementary themes of nature, memory, wildness, and emotional storytelling that suit the mission.

## Backdrop / Interior Atmosphere
ðŸŽµ **Yellow Light** by Of Monsters and Men (2011)

This is the music playing *inside* the sanctuary wallsâ€”an immersive, dreamlike soundscape that invites visitors to let go of fear, follow gentle guidance, and explore transformation in safety.
