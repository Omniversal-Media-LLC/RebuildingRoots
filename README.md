## ❤️ Note for Renee

This repository is being built out collaboratively with Renee, Sage, and Omniversal Media. It captures, organizes, and expands the vision for the Rebuilding Roots Sanctuary and Hotbox Outreach Model. It is a living planning space designed to invite partners, funders, and allies into co-creating a trauma-informed, regenerative sanctuary project.
