## 🌿 Vision

Rebuilding Roots is a sanctuary where both people and animals can rediscover safety, warmth, and purpose. Born from lived experience, our vision is to restore dignity and offer second chances through shared healing. By bringing together the unhoused and neglected animals, we create a space where mutual care fosters hope, love, and growth.

> This isn’t just a shelter. It’s a movement of empathy — where the forgotten are replanted with love.

## 🧡 Closing Note from Renee

> “I’ve been homeless. I’ve been lost. I’ve been one of the ones no one helped. And I’ve also held animals in my arms who needed the same thing I did: a second chance. Rebuilding Roots is for all of us who’ve been forgotten, and for all of us who believe healing is still possible.”
