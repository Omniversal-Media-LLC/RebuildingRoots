# My Head Is an Animal â€” Album Notes

Beyond "Little Talks," the whole album offers imagery and themes valuable to our mission:

## Suggested Tracks for Thematic Use
- "Dirty Paws": myths and origin stories
- "Mountain Sound": collective journey and wild freedom
- "King and Lionheart": loyalty, protection
- "Six Weeks": grief and memory

## Integration Ideas
- Outreach email footers quoting lines
- Playlist for volunteers
- Embedding in online presentations
- Conversation starters in networking calls

## Legality Note
We will not host full audio or lyrics. We will use attribution, summaries, and fair-use commentary.

### Yellow Light
- Serves as the internal mood-setting piece for the sanctuary
- Balances "Little Talks" by offering a more introspective, immersive energy
- Useful for guided meditation, trauma-informed group process, or private reflection spaces
